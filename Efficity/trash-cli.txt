Overview trash-cli
########################
trash-cli is a command-line tool for Linux (and other Unix-like systems)
that provides a recycle bin function that allows users to move files and directories to a trash bin rather than permanently deleting them (unlike rm).
It conforms to the freedesktop.org Trash specification and guarantees compatibility with graphical desktop environments such as GNOME and KDE.

sudo apt install trash-cli [Debian]
sudo dnf install trash-cli [RHEL]
sudo pacman -S trash-cli   [Arch]

ls -la ~/.local/share/Trash/files/ [files]
