Overview trash-cli
########################
trash-cli is a command-line tool for Linux (and other Unix-like systems)
that provides a recycle bin function that allows users to move files and directories to a trash bin rather than permanently deleting them (unlike rm).
It conforms to the freedesktop.org Trash specification and guarantees compatibility with graphical desktop environments such as GNOME and KDE.
