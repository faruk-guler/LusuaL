trash-cli, is a command-line tool for Linux/Unix systems
that provides a recycle bin function that allows users to move files and directories to a trash bin rather than permanently deleting them (unlike rm).
It conforms to the freedesktop.org Trash specification and guarantees compatibility with graphical desktop environments such as GNOME and KDE.
