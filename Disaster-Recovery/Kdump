What is Kdump?

Kdump is a crash dump mechanism used to detect and analyze kernel crashes in Linux operating systems.
When a system crash (kernel panic) occurs, kdump records the current memory state of the system as a dump file (usually called "vmcore").
This dump file is used by system administrators or developers to understand the cause of the crash and perform debugging.
