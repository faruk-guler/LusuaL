What is Kdump?

Kdump is a crash dump mechanism used to detect and analyze kernel crashes in Linux operating systems.
When a system crash (kernel panic) occurs, kdump records the current memory state of the system as a dump file (usually called "vmcore").
This dump file is used by system administrators or developers to understand the cause of the crash and perform debugging.

Kdump consists of two(2) main components:

# Kexec:
Kdump works using the kexec mechanism.
Kexec allows you to start a new kernel directly from memory without restarting the existing kernel.
Kdump starts a "crash kernel" when the system crashes. This kernel saves the current state of the system.

# Kdump Service:
Kdump is a user-space service that is automatically started in the event of a system crash.
This service detects the kernel crash and starts the crash kernel via kexec.
