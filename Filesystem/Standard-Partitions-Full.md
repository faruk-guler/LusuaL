# 💾⚙️ Standard Partitions Management -farukguler.com

Standard disk configuration in Linux usually includes standard partitions. This configuration divides the hard disk into physically separated partitions and formats each as a separate file system. If Linux systems do not have LVM (Logical Volume Manager), standard partitions are used by default.

Standard partitions are used to separate physical disk spaces of a certain size and format each with a separate file system. These partitions may be directories containing system files or user data, such as /boot, /home, /var .etc.
