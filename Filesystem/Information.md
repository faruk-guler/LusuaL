LVM:
‚¶Å The highest number of physical volumes within each volume group is 256.
‚¶Å LVM size is minimum 4MB and maximum 255.99GB.
‚¶Å The maximum volume group (VG) per device is 99.
‚¶Å Traditional partitioning is good, but LVM is better. (RedHat Enterprise)
‚¶Å XFS file system can be expanded but not reducing!! (year 2024) The only solution is to back up the data, delete the volume, create a smaller volume and restore the data there.
‚¶Å Disk reducing is not recommended. If the reducing is greater than the disk capacity, you will lose data!!
