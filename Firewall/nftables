# nftables #

nftables is the modern successor to iptables, which is used to filter, route and enforce security policies on network traffic in Linux operating systems.
It was introduced in 2014 with Linux kernel version 3.13 and was developed based on the Netfilter infrastructure.
nftables combines the functionality of tools such as iptables, ip6tables, arptables and ebtables under a single unified roof and provides high performance.
