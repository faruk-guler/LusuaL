# Kickstart Tutorial
This tutorial will show you the whole process that how to setup a new cluster environment.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## 1 KickstartTest Ubuntu Installation
This section will show you how to use kickstart as an automated installation method to install Ubuntu on several machines.

### Step 1: Install OS on One Machine
Use the dvd drive to install **Ubuntu server 14.04 LTS** on 1 single machine.
Then we need to make sure that the `apt-get` function works perfectly, for we need to download some packages from the Internet.<br>
Of course, we still need to do some configuration with the **/etc/network/interfaces**, to set the IP address of the DHCP server in the LAN. Add this to the end of the file (You should replace `em0` with your own network interface connected to the LAN.)
```
auto em0
iface em0 inet static
address 192.168.2.254
netmask 255.255.255.0
```

### Step 2: Preparing Work
After installing Ubuntu on the machine, we still need to do some preparing work on it.
* Install Needed Packages
```
sudo apt-get install apache2 tftpd-hpa isc-dhcp-server xinetd
```

* Mount the ISO
```
sudo mount -o loop ubuntu-14.04-server-amd64.iso /mnt/ubuntu
```

* Create an Ubuntu Directory Hosted by Apache
```
sudo mkdir /var/www/html/ubuntu
sudo mkdir /var/www/html/cfg
```

* Copy all of the files from your mounted ISO to your newly created Ubuntu directory.
```
sudo cp -rf /mnt/ubuntu/* /var/www/html/ubuntu/
```

* Configuring a TFTP Server Run by xinetd. Edit **/etc/default/tftpd-hpa**, and the resulting file should look like this
```
TFTP_USERNAME="tftp"
TFTP_DIRECTORY="/tftpboot"
TFTP_ADDRESS="0.0.0.0:69"
TFTP_OPTIONS="-l -c -s"
```

* Create new tftpboot directory and copy all of the netboot files to the tftpboot.
```
sudo mkdir /tftpboot
sudo chmod -R 777 /tftpboot
sudo chown -R nobody /tftpboot
sudo cp -R /var/www/html/ubuntu/install/netboot/* /tftpboot/
```

* Configure DHCP. Edit the base configuration of your DHCP server as you wish so that it is ready to answer requests from the network it is connected to. In this sample environment, the resulting **/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf**  file ends up as follows, but it should be adapted to your specific environment:
```
option domain-name-servers 10.248.2.5;
default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200;
allow bootp;
allow booting;
subnet 192.168.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
        range 192.168.2.2 192.168.2.20;
        filename "pxelinux.0";
        option broadcast-address 192.168.2.255;
        option routers 192.168.2.254;
}
```

* Restart all the services you need. You can also use `service <servcieName> status` to check the status.
```
sudo /etc/init.d/xinetd restart
sudo /etc/init.d/isc-dhcp-server restart
sudo /etc/init.d/tftpd-hpa restart
```

### Step 3: Edit Kickstart and Preseed File
* You should create a **ks.cfg** file and a **preseed.cfg** file under the **/var/www/html** directory. In addition, You can check the [ks.cfg](https://github.com/bunguang/KickstartTest/blob/master/ks.cfg) and [preseed.cfg](https://github.com/bunguang/KickstartTest/blob/master/preseed.cfg) for reference.

* In order for your network Ubuntu install to use your kickstart file, you have to tell it where to find it. Edit **/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default**, and it should then look something like this
```
# D-I config version 2.0
default vesamenu.c32
prompt 10
menu TITLE PXE Boot Install Menu PRC SPA
MENU BACKGROUND backgnd.png
timeout 5
label Ubuntu-14.04-Server
kernel ubuntu-installer/amd64/linux
append vga=normal initrd=ubuntu-installer/amd64/initrd.gz ks=http://192.168.2.254/ks.cfg url=http://192.168.2.254/preseed.cfg root=/dev/rd/0 --quiet
```

### Step 4: Autoboot
You should now be able to boot another pc on the LAN over the network and have it install Ubuntu automagically. All you need to do is to restart other machines on the LAN and choose **Network Booting** in their BIOS interfaces.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## 2 Network Configuration
This section will show you how to correctly configure you network, to make the node in the LAN can also access to outer Internet.

### Step 1: Gateway Configuration
Here, we assume that for the gateway, em0 with IP 192.168.2.18 is connected to our small LAN, and eth1 with IP 10.239.47.65 is connected to the outer Internet.
* First, we need to enable the IP forwarding, to link the em0 and eth1 together.
```
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ipforward=1
```

* Then, change the source IP of out packets to gateway’s IP. Don’t worry since iptables will automatically change the replied packet’s destination IP to the original source IP.
```
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING ! -d 192.168.2.0/24 -o eth1 -j SNAT --to-source 10.239.47.65
```

### Step 2: Node Route Configuration
We need to tell the nodes in the LAN where the gateway is, and here we assume that the IP address of gateway in the LAN is **192.168.2.18**. First, we can use `route` command to check the default gateway. If the default gateway is 192.168.2.18, you can directly skip the rest of this section. But if not, I think we need to do some changes (here we assume the default gateway now in the route is **192.168.2.254**).
* First you need to delete the former default gateway
```
sudo route del -net default gw 192.168.2.254
```

* Then we can easily put the new default gateway in the route.
```
sudo route add default gw 192.168.2.18
```

Now, you can use the `ping` command to check that if the node can access outer Internet now.
