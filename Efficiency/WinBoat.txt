# WinBoat

WinBoat is an Electron app which allows you to run Windows apps on Linux using a containerized approach.
Windows runs as a VM inside a Docker container, we communicate with it using the WinBoat Guest Server to retrieve data we need from Windows.
For compositing applications as native OS-level windows, we use FreeRDP together with Windows's RemoteApp protocol.
