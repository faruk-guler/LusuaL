# AppArmor:
##############
AppArmor is a security module used in Linux operating systems.
It works with the Mandatory Access Control (MAC) approach and increases security by restricting applications' access to system resources.
A profile is created for each application, determining which files, directories, or network connections that application can access.
In this way, even if an application tries to behave maliciously, it becomes difficult to cause damage due to access limits.
It is common in Linux distributions such as Ubuntu and Debian.

#
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apparmor apparmor-utils
sudo aa-status
sudo systemctl enable apparmor
sudo systemctl start apparmor

# Create Custom AppArmor Profiles:
cd /etc/apparmor.d/
sudo apparmor_status
sudo aa-genprof /path/to/application
sudo aa-enforce /path/to/profile

# Enforcing or Complain Mode:
sudo aa-enforce /path/to/profile   # Enforce mode
sudo aa-complain /path/to/profile  # Complain mode

# Auditing with AppArmor:
/var/log/syslog
/var/log/audit/audit.log
sudo journalctl -xe | grep apparmor
sudo aa-logprof

# Basic AppArmor Commands:
sudo apparmor_status # Lists active profiles.
sudo aa-complain /path/to/bin   # Puts an application in complaint mode.
sudo aa-enforce /path/to/bin    # Puts an application profile in enforce mode.
sudo systemctl restart apparmor # Restarts the AppArmor service.
