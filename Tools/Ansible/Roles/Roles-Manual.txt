# Ansible Roles:
####################
Ansible Roles are structures used to organize tasks and configurations in a modular way, providing reusable and configurable components.
Roles allow specific tasks to be organized within a playbook. The directory where the roles are located is usually located in roles/

ansible-galaxy role init <role_name> # Creates new role skeleton
ansible-galaxy role remove <role_name> # Deletes the role
ansible-galaxy install <role_name> # Installs the role
ansible-galaxy list # Lists installed roles

cd ~/roles/
<role_name>/
    ├── defaults/
    ├── files/
    ├── handlers/
    ├── meta/
    ├── tasks/
    ├── templates/
    └── vars/
