# Windows Supported Connection:
Unlike Linux/Unix hosts, which use SSH by default, Windows hosts are configured with WinRM.

Windows supported connection plugins are:
-Windows Remote Management - winrm
-PowerShell Remote Access via WinRM - psrp
-SSH - ssh

# Enable WinRM
Enable-PSRemoting -Force

# Start and autostart WinRM service
Start-Service WinRM
Set-Service WinRM -StartupType Automatic

# Quick configuration
winrm quickconfig

# Add listener to listen on port 5985 (HTTP)
winrm set winrm/config/listener?Address=*+Transport=HTTP '@{Port="5985"}'

# Firewall is turned on (optional)
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="WinRM 5985" protocol=TCP dir=in localport=5985 action=allow

# Enumerate Listeners:
winrm enumerate winrm/config/Listener
winrm get winrm/config

# Non-Administrator Accounts: WinRM is configured by default to only allow connections from accounts in the local (Administrators)
winrm configSDDL default
