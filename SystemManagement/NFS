#NFS

#Access and Permission Options
rw → Allows reading and writing.
ro → Allows reading only.
no_root_squash → Root on the client becomes root on the server.
root_squash → Root on the client becomes anonymous on the server (secure).
no_all_squash → User IDs are used unchanged.
all_squash → All client users become anonymous.
anonuid=UID → Assigns a unique UID to the anonymous user.
anongid=GID → Assigns a unique GID to the anonymous user.

#Performance and Security Options
sync → Writes data to disk first, then responds.
async → Writes data to memory first, then saves to disk.
wdelay → Speeds up write operations by grouping them.
no_wdelay → Performs each write operation immediately.
subtree_check → Checks the permissions of shared subdirectories.
no_subtree_check → Disables permission checking (fast but can be a security risk).
crossmnt → Allows access to mounted file systems.
fsid=NUM → Assigns a unique ID to the file system for NFSv4.
secure → Allows connections from ports smaller than 1024.
insecure → Also allows connections from ports larger than 1024.

proto={tcp, udp} → Specifies the protocol to use.
port=N → Uses a specific NFS port.

#Block Size and Caching Options
rsize=N → Specifies the read block size (default 1048576).

lookupcache={all, none, pos, negative} → Manages the file naming cache:
all → Enable all caching.
none → Disable caching completely.
pos → Cache only existing files.
negative → Cache files that cannot be found.
acregmin=N → Cache file changes on the client for at least N seconds.
