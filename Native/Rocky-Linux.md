# What is Rocky Linux?

**Rocky Linux** is an open-source, free Linux distribution designed to be binary-compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). It was created as a community-driven project after Red Hat changed the direction of CentOS to a rolling-release model, making it less suitable for many enterprise users.

## Key Features:
- **RHEL Compatibility**: Rocky Linux is fully compatible with RHEL, providing an alternative to CentOS with similar functionality.
- **Community-Driven**: Developed and maintained by a community of developers and contributors.
- **Stable and Secure**: It offers long-term support (LTS) and security patches, making it a reliable choice for production environments.
- **Open Source**: Free to use, modify, and distribute, adhering to open-source principles.

## Use Cases:
- **Servers**: Ideal for server environments requiring RHEL compatibility and long-term stability.
- **Enterprises**: Suitable for businesses that need an enterprise-grade Linux distribution without the cost of RHEL.
- **Developers**: A great choice for developers who need a reliable, stable, and RHEL-compatible platform.

**Rocky Linux** provides a community-supported, RHEL-compatible solution for users seeking an open-source, stable, and secure alternative to CentOS.
