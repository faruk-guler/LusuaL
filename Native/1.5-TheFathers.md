# The Linux Fathers

## Ken Thompson
Born: February 4, 1943, New Orleans, USA.

Prominent Contributions:

-Unix Operating System: Developed with Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in 1969.

-B Programming Language: The predecessor of C, later converted to C by Dennis Ritchie.

-UTF-8: Contributed to the development of a universal character encoding standard for Unicode.

-Go Programming Language: Designed with Robert Pike and Rob Pike while working at Google.

-Regular Expressions: Became a fundamental tool for text processing in computer science.

Awards: Turing Award (1983), National Medal of Technology (1998), and Japan Prize (2011).


## Richard Stallman (RMS)
Born: March 16, 1953, New York, USA.

Prominent Contributions:

-GNU Project: An attempt to create a free Unix-like operating system, which he started in 1983.

-Free Software Foundation (FSF): A leading organization of the free software movement, founded in 1985.

-GPL (General Public License): A free software license that guarantees that software can be freely distributed and modified.

-Emacs Text Editor and GCC (GNU Compiler Collection): Essential software development tools.

-Philosophy: A "free software" advocate; argues that software should protect user freedom.

Controversies: Criticized for his personal views and behavior. Resigned from his positions in the FSF and the GNU Project in 2019.


## Linus Torvalds
Born: December 28, 1969, Helsinki, Finland.

Notable Contributions:

Linux Kernel: Started as a personal project in 1991, today the world's most widely used open source operating system kernel.
-Git: Distributed version control system revolutionized software development.

-Open Source Contribution: The success of Linux has led to the growth of the open source community.

-Current Role: Oversees development of the Linux kernel and works for the Linux Foundation.

-Style: Known for his direct and sometimes harsh criticism, but took a hiatus in 2018 to change his tone.

Awards: Millennium Technology Prize (2012), IEEE Computer Pioneer Award (2014).

## Dennis Ritchie
Dennis Ritchie is an American computer scientist who is a pioneering figure in the field of computer science and is known as the creator of the C programming language. He also played a significant role in the development of the UNIX operating system.

The C language, developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the 1970s, is one of the cornerstones of modern programming languages.
C has a wide range of uses, from low-level system programming to high-level applications.

- Turing Award (1983): For the development of the UNIX operating system together with Ken Thompson and contributions to the theory of operating systems.
- National Medal of Technology (1998): Awarded by US President Bill Clinton for the C language and UNIX.
- Japan Prize (2011): For contributions to the field of information technology.
