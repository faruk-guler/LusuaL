# Rocky Linux

**Rocky Linux** is an open-source, free Linux distribution that is binary-compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). It was created as a community-driven alternative to **CentOS** after Red Hat shifted CentOS to a rolling-release model.

## Key Features:
- **Stability**: Provides a secure, reliable, and stable system with long-term support (LTS).
- **Open Source**: Completely free and open-source.
- **Package Management**: Uses **RPM** packages and **DNF** for easy software management.
- **Support**: Community-driven with long-term support updates.

## Use Cases:
- **Servers**: A great choice for enterprises requiring a stable, RHEL-compatible environment.
- **Developers**: Ideal for developers seeking a RHEL-like experience without the associated costs.

**Rocky Linux** is a solid, community-supported alternative to **CentOS**, offering the same compatibility and enterprise-level reliability.
