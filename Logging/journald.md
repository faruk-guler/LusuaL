journald is an advanced log management system. It collects logs from the kernel, boot processes and services and stores them as binary under /run/log/journal.
The logs collected by journald can be queried with the journalctl command. Journald logs are not permanent. 
When the system is restarted, it transfers the logs to rsyslogd. rsyslogd then distributes the logs to the relevant log files.
journald can write logs to specified files, manage logs remotely and provide log sending to log servers.
